Thank you for your time! I hope you find these projects as interesting as I did.


# [Project 1: Virtual Casino Slot Machine]

This was a personal project that tested my understanding of fundamental and intermediate python concepts. The model works by prompting the player to place a bet and choose the amount of lines they wish to bet on. There are some underlying conditions to the game that are integrated into the code, such as: a maximum bet for each line ($100) and a range of lines that can be selected (1-3). The game is built to progress through a boolean loop to keep the fun going until your bet runs out. Give it a try here: 


# [Project 2: IBM HR Data Analysis]

* This project utilizes IBM Human Rescources data to make observations about employees within the company on the basis of gender, age, income, etc.
* Utilizing Excel for this data extract, I scrubbed the data of duplicates and erroneous data that could cloud my results.
* I built a dashboard that displays the intersections of gender, marital status, income and age on job roles.
* Findings: In a male dominated company, such as IBM, men occupy senior leadership roles at a younger age than women. In 66% of managerial roles listed, men were younger on average than their female peers.

# [Project 3: Worldwide COVID-19 Vaccinations]

* This project looks at data from September 2020 through October 2021 to identify trends in vaccinations as it compares to their economic standing.
* Findings: Over 48% of the population included in the data were at least partially vaccinated. Secondly, many of the countries that trended positively in vaccinations per hundred people were in good economic standing compared to other countries.
* Shortcomings: There were some holes in this data that were not accounted for, such as population size or access to the vaccine. For example, China has a GDP per capita below $30,000. However, their vaccinations per hundred people are among the highest. This data does not account for a country's ability to get access to the vaccine either.
* Final thoughts: This snapshot of data was interesting to analyze; however, all circumstances were not accounted for and should not be observed as such.
